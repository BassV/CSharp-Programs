Description:

Count the number of Duplicates

Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters that occur more than once in the given string. The given string can be assumed to contain only uppercase and lowercase alphabets.

Example

"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabbcdeB" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i'
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' and 's'
