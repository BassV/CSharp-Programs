http://www.codewars.com/kata/multiples-of-3-and-5

Description:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Examples:

For numbers below 10, the sum is: 23
For numbers below 0, the sum is: 0
For numbers below 20, the sum is: 78
For numbers below 27, the sum is: 168
